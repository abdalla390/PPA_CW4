Bedouin Madness - Game Description

Bedouin Madness is a fast-paced, side-scrolling platformer set in a treacherous desert landscape. Players control a nimble Bedouin warrior who must navigate through ten increasingly challenging levels while avoiding deadly creatures and hazardous terrain.

Story
A skilled Bedouin warrior embarks on a perilous journey across the scorching desert to reach the sacred oasis. Ancient legends speak of riches and wisdom awaiting those brave enough to complete this treacherous pilgrimage.

Gameplay
The player starts with three hearts and must reach the end of each level as quickly as possible. Moving platforms, shifting sand dunes, and deadly quicksand pits create challenging platforming sequences. The faster a player completes a level, the higher their score - with a maximum of 10 points available per level.

Environment
The game features a striking desert aesthetic with:

Sprawling sand dunes
Spiky cacti and palm trees
Desert rock formations
Shimmering mirages
A blazing sun overhead

Enemies
The desert is home to dangerous creatures:

Scorpions that scuttle across the sand
Vultures that swoop down from above
Venomous snakes that lunge unexpectedly

Progression
As players advance through the ten levels, they face:

More complex jumping challenges
Faster and more numerous enemies
Trickier environmental hazards
Narrower platforms and precise timing requirements

Scoring

Players earn points based on completion speed
1 second = 9 points
3 seconds = 7 points
10 seconds = 1 point (minimum)
Maximum possible score across all levels: 100 points

Victory and Defeat
Players win by completing all ten levels. If all three hearts are lost, the game ends in defeat. The final score represents the player's mastery of both speed and survival skills.

Controls
Intuitive controls allow players to run, jump, and navigate the perilous desert with precision and agility as they race against time to maximize their score
